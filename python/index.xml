      <description>In this article will be looking at some of the ways to write object based design code in python.
Iteratoring over collection of items Iterators are classes which are defined to iterate over the collection of objects. You can use the iterator for example iterating over students enrolled in a course. This can be done let&amp;rsquo;s say when the internal structure of the students is not exposed or we need to lazy load the students from the database or the network only when iterate over a particular object rather than loading the whole collection of objects.</description>

      <description>This post list some of the python code snippets which are useful in coding interviews and problem solving. Such snippets, although are easy to remember and are often used in many problems.
Added here for reference and some common gotchas.
Initialize an array with initial values # Initialize an array of size n with 0 # Creates an array as [0, 0, 0] if n = 3 a = [0] * n # another way to write this: # 0, 0, 0 a = [ 0 for _ in range(3)] # Initialize an 2D array of size rows `n` and `m` columns with value 0 # Creates an array as [[0,0], [0,0], [0,0]] if n = 3, m = 2 a = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)] # Do not use, * operator to create multi-dimension list as it `*` copies references.</description>
