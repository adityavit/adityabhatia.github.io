      <description>Stacks are quite simple data structures with LIFO (Last In First Out) property. I added this post with the implementation of a stack using list/slice in python and go.
More constraint properties can be added to this simple stack structure, which can help solve multiple other problems.
In this post I will be talking about stack with monotonic property.
Monotone means same or unchanging. Defining stacks with monotonic increasing/decreasing properties means all elements in the stack are unchangingly increasing or decreasing in nature.</description>

      <description>Using list as a stack in python Stacks come very handy in solving some of the problems. Often using just an array does the purpose rather than specific data structures.
In python to use a list as a stack is straight forward with append and pop methods already available.
if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: st = [] for i in range(10): st.append(i) for i in range(10): top = st.pop() print(top)  Using slices as a stack in go In go to use slices as a stack, push and pop methods are missing.</description>

      <title>Partitioning an Array</title>

      <description>Paritioning an array is a common problem in computer science. In quick sort, the array is partitioned into smaller/equal and larger values based on the pivot. There are many other partition problems partition function is different than the one in quick sort. Here adding a generic code template to solve such partition problems in O(n) time and O(1) space (or without using extra space).
2 way partition problem
Examples:
 Partition the array such that all the even numbers come before all the odd numbers.</description>
